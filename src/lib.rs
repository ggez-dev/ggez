//! ggez is a Rust library to create a Good Game Easily.
//!
//! More specifically, ggez is a lightweight game framework for making
//! 2D games with minimum friction.  It aims to implement an API based
//! on (a Rustified version of) the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) game
//! framework.  This means it will contain basic and portable 2D
//! drawing, sound, resource loading and event handling.
//!
//! ggez is not meant to be everything to everyone, but rather a good
//! base upon which to build.  Thus it takes a fairly
//! batteries-included approach without needing a million additions
//! and plugins for everything imaginable, but also does not dictate
//! higher-level functionality such as physics engine or entity
//! component system.  Instead the goal is to allow you to use
//! whichever libraries you want to provide these functions, or build
//! your own libraries atop ggez.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * Filesystem abstraction that lets you load resources from folders or zip files
//! * Hardware-accelerated rendering engine built on the `gfx-rs` graphics engine
//! * Loading and playing .ogg, .wav and .flac files via the `rodio` crate
//! * TTF font rendering with `rusttype`, as well as bitmap fonts.
//! * Interface for handling keyboard and mouse events easily through callbacks
//! * Config file for defining engine and game settings
//! * Easy timing and FPS measurement functions.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ggez is built on the latest stable Rust compiler and distributed on
//! crates.io.  To include it in your project, just add the dependency
//! line to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```text
//! ggez = "0.3"
//! ```
//!
//! However you also need to have the SDL2 libraries installed on your
//! system.  The best way to do this is documented [by the SDL2
//! crate](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2#user-content-requirements).
//!
//! ggez consists of three main parts: A `Context` object which
//! contains all the state required to interface with the computer's
//! hardware, an `EventHandler` trait that the user implements to
//! register callbacks for events, and various sub-modules such as
//! `graphics` and `audio` that provide the functionality to actually
//! get stuff done.  The general pattern is to create a struct holding
//! your game's data which implements the `EventHandler` trait.
//! Create a `Conf` object with the default values you want in it,
//! Create a new `Context` from it, and then call `event::run()` with
//! the `Context` and an instance of your `EventHandler`.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! See the `examples/` directory in the source.  `hello_world` is exactly
//! what it says.  `imageview` is a simple program that shows off a number
//! of features such as sound and drawing.  `astroblasto` is a small
//! but complete Asteroids-like game.
//!
//! To run the examples, you have to tell your program where to find the
//! `resources` directory included in the git repository.  The easy way is
//! to enable `cargo-resource-root` feature flag to tell ggez to look for a
//! `resources` directory next to your `Cargo.toml`, or copy or symlink
//! the `resources` directory to a place the running game can find it
//! (such as next to the game executable).
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example astroblasto --features=cargo-resource-root
//! ```
//!
//! Either way, if it can't find the resources it will give you an error
//! along the lines of `ResourceNotFound("'resources' directory not
//! found!  Should be in "/home/foo/src/ggez/target/debug/resources")`.
//! Just copy or symlink the `resources/` directory to where the error says it's
//! looking.
//!
//! ## Implementation details
//!
//! ggez is built upon SDL2 for windowing and events, `rodio` for sound,
//! and a 2D drawing engine implemented in `gfx` using the OpenGL backend
//! (which currently defaults to use OpenGL 3.2).  It *should* be
//! entirely thread-safe outside of the basic event-handling loop, and
//! portable to Windows, Linux and Mac.
//!
//! The goal is to eventually have ggez be pure Rust, but we're not there
//! yet.
