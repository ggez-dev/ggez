//! ggez is a Rust library to create a Good Game Easily.
//!
//! More specifically, ggez is a lightweight game framework for making
//! 2D games with minimum friction.  It aims to implement an API based
//! on (a Rustified version of) the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) game
//! framework.  This means it contains basic and portable 2D
//! drawing, sound, resource loading and event handling.
//!
//! ggez is not meant to be everything to everyone, but rather a good
//! base upon which to build.  Thus it takes a fairly
//! batteries-included approach without needing a million additions
//! and plugins for everything imaginable, but also does not dictate
//! higher-level functionality such as physics engine or entity
//! component system.  Instead the goal is to allow you to use
//! whichever libraries you want to provide these functions, or build
//! your own libraries atop ggez.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * Filesystem abstraction that lets you load resources from folders or zip files
//! * Hardware-accelerated 2D rendering built on the `gfx-rs` graphics engine
//! * Loading and playing .ogg, .wav and .flac files via the `rodio` crate
//! * TTF font rendering with `rusttype`, as well as bitmap fonts.
//! * Interface for handling keyboard and mouse events easily through callbacks
//! * Config file for defining engine and game settings
//! * Easy timing and FPS measurement functions.
//! * Math integration with nalgebra
//! * Some more advanced graphics options: shaders, sprite batches and render targets
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ggez is built on the latest stable Rust compiler and distributed on
//! crates.io.  To include it in your project, just add the dependency
//! line to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```text
//! ggez = "0.4"
//! ```
//!
//! However you also need to have the SDL2 libraries installed on your
//! system.  The best way to do this is documented [by the SDL2
//! crate](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2#user-content-requirements).
//!
//! ggez consists of three main parts: A `Context` object which
//! contains all the state required to interface with the computer's
//! hardware, an `EventHandler` trait that the user implements to
//! register callbacks for events, and various sub-modules such as
//! `graphics` and `audio` that provide the functionality to actually
//! get stuff done.  The general pattern is to create a struct holding
//! your game's data which implements the `EventHandler` trait.
//! Create a new `Context` object with default objects from a `ContextBuilder`
//! or `Conf` object, and then call `event::run()` with
//! the `Context` and an instance of your `EventHandler` to run your game's
//! main loop.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! See the `examples/` directory in the source.  Most examples show off
//! a single feature of ggez, while `astroblasto` is a small  but
//! complete Asteroids-like game.
//!
//! To run the examples, just check out the source and execute `cargo run --example`
//! in the root directory:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example astroblasto
//! ```
//!
//! If this doesn't work, see the
//! [FAQ](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md) for solutions
//! to common problems.
//!
//! ## Implementation details
//!
//! ggez is built upon SDL2 for windowing and events, `rodio` for sound,
//! and a 2D drawing engine implemented in `gfx` using the OpenGL backend
//! (which currently defaults to use OpenGL 3.2).  It *should* be
//! entirely thread-safe outside of the basic event-handling loop, and
//! portable to Windows, Linux and Mac.
//!
//! The goal is to eventually have ggez be pure Rust, but we're not there
//! yet.
//!
//! ## Help!
//!
//! Sources of information:
//!
//!  * The [FAQ](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md) has answers to common questions and problems.
//!  * The [API docs](https://docs.rs/ggez/), a lot of design stuff is explained there.
//!  * Check out the [examples](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/tree/master/examples).
