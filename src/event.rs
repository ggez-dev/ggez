//! The `event` module contains traits and structs to actually run your game mainloop
//! and handle top-level state, as well as handle input events such as keyboard
//! and mouse.
//!
//! If you don't want to do this, you can write your own mainloop and
//! get the necessary event machinery by calling
//! `context.sdl_context.event_pump()` on your `Context`.  You can
//! then call whatever SDL event methods you want on that.  This is
//! not particularly elegant and is not guaranteed to be stable across
//! different versions of ggez (for instance, we may someday get rid of SDL2),
//! but trying to wrap it
//! up more conveniently really ends up with the exact same interface.
//!
//! See the `eventloop` example for an implementation.
